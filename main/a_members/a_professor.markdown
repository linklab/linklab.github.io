            <p>
                My primary research interest in in the area of intelligent networking and
                they
                include: 1) social network analysis, 2) cross-layering mobility on mobile
                devices
                and sensor nodes, and 3) sensor self-configuration and scheduling. He has
                done
                research in mobility management for IP-based mobile Internet since he was
                enrolled
                in his doctoral course. He also has a research experience about
                Object-oriented
                Language and Database of which subjects are what he did research during his
                master’s
                course. Since 2002, his activities have focused on IPv6, (Proxy) Mobile
                IPv6, media
                independent handover, and cross-layer optimization for efficient mobility
                support.
                Currently, his primary research topic is social network analysis and
                intelligent
                self-configuration schemes of mobile sensor networks. He has published
                approximately
                100 research papers on the theory and application of mobile computing, as
                well as
                books on some practical programming language. He has also the filed
                application of
                20 patents on next-generation internet area. He was the chair of ‘IPv6 over
                WiBro’

                mobile
                devices by supporting seamless handover between heterogeneous networks. The results
                make it
                possible for mobile devices to perform seamless handover where diverse access
                networks
                support them. The working group accepted his contributions “Command Service from
                Upper Layer
                to Lower Layer” and “Media Independent Neighbot Graph” in its draft standard. He is
                also an
                author of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5181" target="_blank">RFC 5181</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5270" target="_blank">RFC 5270</a>, and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7864" target="_blank">RFC 7864</a>.
            </p>

                Currently, he is very interested in artificial intelligence technology, especially
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank">reinforcement learning.</a>
                He is very interested in improving the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms, and continues to work
                on optimizing the performance by applying reinforcement learning agents to various fields, such as intelligent networking on 5G and 6G,
                IoT (Internet of Things), smart factory, and financial engineering.
